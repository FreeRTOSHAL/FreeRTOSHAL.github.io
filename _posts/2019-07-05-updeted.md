FreeRTOS HAL is grown over the years it is correctly used at RheinMain University of Applied Sciences and support much more SOCs since release 1.1.
The HAL is tested under some student projects.
One of this project is can be found [here][CaroloCup]. 
In this project is used for autonomous model car and implement the low-level controller.
Communication is done by Shared Memory and remote controller.
The Shared Memmory is used by the Linux side of the AM57xx SOC. 

Nowadays is support:
  * NXP VF610 (Cortex-M4 only)
  * NXP IMX6sx (Cortex-M4 only)
  * NXP S32k
  * ST STM32
  * TI AM57xx (Cortex-M4 only)

Driver Support for each core:

x=supported, /=not tested, o=only software emulation supported

The CAN Subsystem is correctly under construction, interface is designed but not implement.
Support for AM57xx will be added soon.
